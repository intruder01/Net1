1. debug functions and display:
	a. cell
		- active		DONE
		- inhibited		DONE
		- learning
		- predicting
			- correctly
			- incorrectly
	b. connections
		- proximal		DONE
			- strength display
		- basal
		- apical ?? 
	c. added Column ref to Cell for debug purpose
		- remove when done

2. added PREDICTABLE conditional compilation symbol
		- this will need to be managed going forward

3. Test whether IsVisible is a viable method to utilize for Picking. 
	Currently picking conditions need to reflect display conditions and this is hard to maintain.
4. Can IsDataGridSelected be used as "IsPropertyWindowSelected" ??
